      <description>I am currently Data Scientist at GoGuardian working on creating filtering solutions for K-12 students. By collaborating with data-engineers, software-engineers, project-managers, business intellingence analysis, I have been able to help keep students safe and focused online. By using simple (keyword look-up) to complex (fine-tuned transormers) approaches we can robustly categorize the internet at it expands and evolves.
Previosly I worked as Coastal Oceanographer at the U. S. Geological Survey with Dr.</description>

However, waves drive many processes along our coastlines including, beach erosion, coastal flooding, and alongshore transport of sediment, larvae and pollutants. Additionally, large wave energy provide a significant hazard to coastal infrastructure, beach goers and commercial and recreational boating. Therefore accurate, unbiased, high-resolution nearshore wave predictions are needed by both local communities and researchers.</description>
