      <description>I am a Coastal Oceanographer at the U. S. Geological Survey working with Dr. Eric E. Grossman. Additionally, I am Research Affiliate at Western Washington University mentoring with graduate students in the Geology and Environmental Sciences Departments and occasionally teach Oceanography of the Salish Sea (ESCI491) for the Huxley College of the Environment.
My research interests are inspired by the intersection of land and sea. I study coastal processes including regional wave transformation; high water level modeling (episodic flooding and long-term inundation); sediment transport, beach erosion, and cliff retreat.</description>

      <description>Modeling Ocean Waves Oneâ€™s first thought when considering ocean waves might be those that roll gently up our beaches, providing endless entertainment of surfers, body boarders, and beach goers alike. However, waves drive many processes along our coastlines including, beach erosion, coastal flooding, and alongshore transport of sediment, larvae and pollutants. Additionally, large wave energy provide a significant hazard to coastal infrastructure, beach goers and commercial and recreational boating. Therefore accurate, unbiased, high-resolution nearshore wave predictions are needed by both local communities and researchers.</description>
