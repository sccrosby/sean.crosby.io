I am currently Data Scientist at [GoGuardian](https://www.goguardian.com/) working on creating filtering solutions for K-12 students. By collaborating with data-engineers, software-engineers, project-managers, business intellingence analysis, I have been able to help keep students safe and focused online. By using simple (keyword look-up) to complex (fine-tuned transormers) approaches we can robustly categorize the internet at it expands and evolves.

Previosly I worked as Coastal Oceanographer at the [U. S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) with [Dr. Eric E. Grossman](https://cse.wwu.edu/geology/grossme2). Additionally, I served as a Research Affiliate at [Western Washington University](https://www.wwu.edu/) mentoring with graduate students in the [Geology](https://cse.wwu.edu/geology) and [Environmental Sciences](https://www.wwu.edu/majors/environmental-science) Departments and occasionally teach Oceanography of the Salish Sea (ESCI491) for the [Huxley College of the Environment](https://huxley.wwu.edu/).

While my interests have recently expanded to include NLP, data-workflows, and systems engineerings, my oceanography interests are inspired by the intersection of land and sea. I study coastal processes including regional wave transformation; high water level modeling (episodic flooding and long-term inundation);  sediment transport, beach erosion, and cliff retreat.  

In February 2017 I completed my PhD in physical oceanography at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/). Under the guidance of [Dr. Robert T. Guza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R_Guza) my [dissertation](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3pk2b7z7)  focused on obtaining accurate, high-resolution coastal wave predictions by assimilating wave buoy observations into regional wave models.
